# WASM Build Artifacts

This directory contains the WebAssembly build artifacts generated by Emscripten.

## Files

- `unrar.js` - JavaScript glue code generated by Emscripten
- `unrar.wasm` - WebAssembly binary containing the compiled UnRAR library

## Building

To generate these files, run the build script from the repository root:

```bash
./build_wasm.sh
```

This requires the Emscripten SDK to be installed and activated.

## Note

These files are automatically excluded from version control (see `.gitignore`).
Each developer/deployment needs to build them locally using the build script.
